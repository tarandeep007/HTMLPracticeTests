Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation.

The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.

Technology is neutral; it depends on how it's used.

Technology and social media have brought power back to the people.

Good, bad or indifferent, if you are not investing in new technology, you are going to be left behind.
